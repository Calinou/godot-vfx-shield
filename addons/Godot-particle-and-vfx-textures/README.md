# Textures for Particles, Visual Effects, Lights and Lensflares

Here you will find a collection of textures I created, to be used for lensflares, lights, particles and visual effects.

![overview](https://github.com/RPicster/Godot-particle-and-vfx-textures/blob/main/textures/overview.jpg "Texture Overview")

The textures are supplied in 1024x1024, 256x256 and 64x64 pixels, in a black and white version and alpha version.
They are very high quality with a close attention to levels and gradients.
There are also Blender files that I used to render the original textures to work with.


Also supplied is a demo project for the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/) that demonstrates how to use these textures in a practical application.

You can also have a look at the YouTube video showing the creation of the demo project and explaining the process a bit more in depth.
